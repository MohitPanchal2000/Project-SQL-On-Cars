# Project-SQL-On-Cars
Project Title: Automotive Data Analysis using SQL

Description:
In this project, I engaged in a focused exploration of automotive data using SQL, demonstrating my adeptness at data management, querying, and analysis within the context of the automotive industry. By leveraging SQL, I conducted an in-depth examination of a diverse dataset related to cars, unearthing valuable insights that could inform business strategies and decision-making processes.

Key Achievements:

Data Integration and Database Design: I orchestrated the integration of a comprehensive automotive dataset, comprising vehicle specifications, sales records, and market trends, into a structured SQL database. By employing database design principles, I ensured data consistency, integrity, and optimized query performance.

*Complex Query Formulation: I crafted intricate SQL queries to dissect the dataset, extracting nuanced information such as top-selling car models, regional sales distributions, and average price variations across different vehicle categories.

*Performance Analysis: Through rigorous querying, I identified performance trends among various car manufacturers and analyzed factors contributing to fluctuations in sales volume and market share.

*Data Enrichment: I augmented the raw dataset with calculated fields, aggregations, and calculated metrics, enhancing the depth of analysis and facilitating the identification of correlations and patterns.

*Automated Reporting: I developed automated SQL scripts to generate regular reports summarizing key performance indicators and insights. This streamlined reporting process enabled swift decision-making by providing stakeholders with up-to-date information.

*Collaboration and Communication: Working collaboratively with team members, I fine-tuned the scope of analysis based on their requirements and communicated findings through clear, concise presentations that distilled complex SQL-derived insights into actionable takeaways.
